# Title: Library Managment System
An automated system to manage a public library. Admin panel for librarians to control and manage the system easily through an interactive interface.

## 3. Input/Output
The user has to give his/her userid and password as input or create an account if the user is new. The details are authenticated by the sql database. When the user
enters his/her details he will be directed to the homepage. There the user gets options to add or issue or return books. The librarian gets to add students and 
control the books being issued.
